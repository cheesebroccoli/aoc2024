Hello! 
If you are reading this, why?

  I started the advent of code, I started around 17:45 and I think I am done now at 18:56.
  I've never messed with files on java so that was interesting. I chose java because it's pretty much the only language I've been using but after this I am going to switch becaues honestly that sucked. Like I needed to look up a bunch of functions anyways, so it wasn't like my knowledge was all the useful.
Right now I'm thinking Python but I'm also following people doing aoc and they're doing it on python so, not sure.
22:07 (back from dinner, Chase was paralyzed for a bit and fell in love with a nun)
I cheated a little bit. Okay I cheated a lot of bit, I didn't want to come up with my own algorithm so I took a quicksort alg from the internet. It worked though- I'm on part 2! I don't know if I want to do the second one though. I have an idea but it's a linear algorithm which I think will end badly for my computer...
So I'm a bit stuck, because part 2 is all about similarity. From what I can see, the score is number*frequency, added up

I am a genius. I forgot to reset frequency.
