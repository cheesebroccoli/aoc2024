Hello! 
If you are reading this, why?

  I started the advent of code, I started around 17:45 and I think I am done now at 18:56.
  I've never messed with files on java so that was interesting. I chose java because it's pretty much the only language I've been using but after this I am going to switch becaues honestly that sucked. Like I needed to look up a bunch of functions anyways, so it wasn't like my knowledge was all the useful.
Right now I'm thinking Python but I'm also following people doing aoc and they're doing it on python so...
